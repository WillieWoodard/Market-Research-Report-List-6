<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Lateral Epicondylitis Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Arthroscopic Surgery</li><li>Open Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical treatment for lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, can be divided into two main types: arthroscopic surgery and open surgery. Arthroscopic surgery involves using a small camera and specialized instruments to repair the damaged tissue through small incisions, resulting in less scarring and a quicker recovery time. On the other hand, open surgery requires a larger incision to access the affected area directly. Both methods are effective in treating lateral epicondylitis, and the choice between them depends on the severity of the condition and the preference of the surgeon.</p></p>
