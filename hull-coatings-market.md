<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hull Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Polishing Coatings (SPCs)</li><li>Fouling Release Coatings (FRC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hull coatings market features two primary types: Self-Polishing Coatings (SPCs) and Fouling Release Coatings (FRC). SPCs gradually release biocides when submerged, preventing marine organism attachment and providing long-lasting protection. This dynamic allows for continuous cleaning as the vessel moves. Conversely, FRCs create a smooth surface that reduces friction, enabling fouling organisms to be easily removed by water flow, thus enhancing vessel efficiency. Both types aim to improve vessel performance and longevity while minimizing maintenance costs.</p></p>
