<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Membrane Air Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous Type Industrial Membrane Air Dryers</li><li>Non-Porous Type Industrial Membrane Air Dryers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial Membrane Air Dryers are divided into two main types - Porous Type and Non-Porous Type. Porous Type Industrial Membrane Air Dryers use membranes with small pores that allow water vapor to pass through while blocking larger molecules, effectively drying the air. On the other hand, Non-Porous Type Industrial Membrane Air Dryers use membranes that do not have any pores, relying on other mechanisms such as thermal or pressure differentials to remove moisture from the air. These two types offer different solutions for air drying in industrial settings.</p></p>
