<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plastic Rolling Bearings</li><li>Plastic Sliding Bearings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plastic bearings are divided into two main types: plastic rolling bearings and plastic sliding bearings. Plastic rolling bearings utilize rolling elements such as balls or rollers to reduce friction and allow for smooth rotation, making them suitable for applications with moderate loads and speeds. On the other hand, plastic sliding bearings operate without rolling elements, relying on sliding contact to provide support and motion. These bearings are commonly used in low-speed and high-load applications where smooth and quiet operation is required.</p></p>
