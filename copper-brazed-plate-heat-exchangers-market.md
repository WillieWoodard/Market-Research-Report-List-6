<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Copper Brazed Plate Heat Exchangers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi Circuit Heat Exchangers</li><li>Single Circuit Heat Exchangers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Copper brazed plate heat exchangers come in two main types: multi-circuit heat exchangers and single-circuit heat exchangers. Multi-circuit heat exchangers have multiple flow channels for increased heat transfer capacity, making them suitable for applications requiring high heat transfer efficiency. On the other hand, single-circuit heat exchangers have only one flow channel, making them more suitable for simpler, lower capacity applications. Both types offer efficient heat transfer capabilities due to the copper brazing technology used in their construction.</p></p>
