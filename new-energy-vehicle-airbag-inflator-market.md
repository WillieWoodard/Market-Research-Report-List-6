<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The New Energy Vehicle Airbag Inflator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Inflator</li><li>Stored Gas Inflator</li><li>Hybrid Inflator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The New Energy Vehicle Airbag Inflator market features three primary types: pyrotechnic inflators, stored gas inflators, and hybrid inflators. Pyrotechnic inflators utilize a combustion process to generate gas rapidly, inflating airbags upon collision. Stored gas inflators rely on compressed gas stored in a container, releasing it to deploy airbags. Hybrid inflators combine elements of both systems, using pyrotechnics and stored gas for enhanced performance and reliability. Each type offers distinct benefits, tailored to the evolving needs of modern vehicles.</p></p>
