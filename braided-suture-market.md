<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Braided Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Braided Suture</li><li>Non-absorbable Braided Suture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The braided suture market is divided into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable braided sutures. Absorbable braided sutures are designed to deteriorate naturally in the body, eliminating the need for removal after healing, making them ideal for internal surgical procedures. In contrast, non-absorbable braided sutures are intended for long-term use, offering strength and durability for external repairs or conditions requiring permanent support. Both types serve critical roles in various surgical applications, ensuring tissue approximation and effective wound closure.</p></p>
