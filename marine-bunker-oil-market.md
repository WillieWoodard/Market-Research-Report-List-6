<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Bunker Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Residual Fuel</li><li>Distillate Fuel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Marine Bunker Oil market is categorized into two main types: Residual Fuel and Distillate Fuel. Residual Fuel, often referred to as bunker fuel, is a heavy and viscous oil suitable for large vessels, providing higher energy content, but requires treatment due to its impurities. In contrast, Distillate Fuel, such as marine gasoil, is lighter and cleaner, suitable for smaller vessels and providing better combustion efficiency. Both fuel types play crucial roles in maritime operations, influencing cost, emissions, and compliance with environmental standards.</p></p>
