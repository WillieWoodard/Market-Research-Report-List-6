<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy for CNS Disorders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ex Vivo</li><li>In Vivo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene Therapy for CNS Disorders involves two main market types: Ex Vivo and In Vivo. </p><p>Ex Vivo gene therapy involves modifying cells outside the body before re-introducing them into the patient's body. This method allows for more precise targeting and modification of the cells. In Vivo gene therapy, on the other hand, involves directly delivering the therapeutic gene into the patient's body. This method is less invasive but may have limitations in terms of targeting specific cells. Both methods are being explored for the treatment of CNS disorders.</p></p>
