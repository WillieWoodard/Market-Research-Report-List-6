<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overactive Bladder (OAB) Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anticholinergic Agents</li><li>Beta-3 Adrenoreceptor Agonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Overactive Bladder (OAB) therapeutics market includes two main types of medications: Anticholinergic Agents and Beta-3 Adrenoreceptor Agonists. Anticholinergic agents work by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in bladder contraction. This helps to reduce bladder spasms and control the urge to urinate. Beta-3 Adrenoreceptor Agonists work by targeting beta-3 adrenergic receptors in the bladder, leading to relaxation of the detrusor muscle and increased bladder capacity. Both types of medications are commonly prescribed to manage symptoms of OAB.</p></p>
