<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electricity Transmission Towers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC</li><li>DC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electricity transmission towers are vital components of power grids, facilitating the efficient transfer of electricity over long distances. There are two main types of transmission towers: AC (alternating current) and DC (direct current). AC towers are designed to carry high-voltage alternating current, which is the most commonly used form of electricity transmission. DC towers, on the other hand, are used for transmitting direct current, which is more commonly used in certain applications like long-distance undersea cables. Both types of towers play a crucial role in ensuring a reliable and stable electricity supply.</p></p>
