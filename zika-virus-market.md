<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zika Virus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Molecular Test</li><li>Serologic Test</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Zika Virus market is primarily divided into two types of diagnostic tests: molecular tests and serologic tests. Molecular tests, such as PCR, detect the virus's genetic material, providing timely and accurate diagnosis during the active infection phase. In contrast, serologic tests identify antibodies produced in response to the virus, useful for diagnosis after infection has resolved. Both testing types are essential for monitoring outbreaks, guiding public health responses, and ensuring effective management of Zika virus cases in affected populations.</p></p>
