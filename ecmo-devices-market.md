<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ECMO Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ECMO devices market is primarily divided into two types: Veno-Arterial (VA) ECMO and Veno-Venous (VV) ECMO. VA ECMO is used to support both cardiac and respiratory functions by providing oxygen-rich blood to the body while assisting heart function, often employed in patients with cardiac failure. In contrast, VV ECMO focuses solely on respiratory support, allowing oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal when the lungs are severely compromised, making it suitable for patients with respiratory failure. Both types are crucial in critical care settings.</p></p>
