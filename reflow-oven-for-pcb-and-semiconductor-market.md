<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reflow Oven for PCB and Semiconductor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Convection Reflow Oven</li><li>Vapour Phase Reflow Oven</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reflow ovens are essential equipment in the PCB and semiconductor industry for soldering components onto printed circuit boards. Two common types of reflow ovens are convection reflow ovens and vapour phase reflow ovens. Convection reflow ovens use heated air to melt solder paste on components, while vapour phase reflow ovens use a special fluid with a lower boiling point than solder to create a controlled environment for soldering. Both types offer precise temperature control and efficient soldering capabilities for manufacturing electronic devices.</p></p>
