<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquefied Gas Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Screw</li><li>Reciprocating</li><li>Axial Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The liquefied gas compressor market is divided into three main types: screw, reciprocating, and axial flow compressors. Screw compressors utilize two helical rotors to compress gas, offering high efficiency and smooth operation, making them suitable for continuous operations. Reciprocating compressors use pistons driven by a crankshaft, providing high pressure and flexibility for varying capacities. Axial flow compressors move gas along the axis of the compressor through rotating blades, delivering high flow rates at lower pressures, ideal for large-scale applications.</p></p>
