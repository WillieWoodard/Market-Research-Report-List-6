<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Modifying Immunotherapy for Blood Cancer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CAR T-cell Therapy</li><li>TCR T-cell Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene modifying immunotherapy for blood cancer involves the manipulation of a patient's immune cells to target and destroy cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy involves modifying a patient's own T cells to express chimeric antigen receptors, enabling them to recognize and attack cancer cells. TCR T-cell therapy involves modifying T cells to express T cell receptors that can recognize specific antigens on cancer cells. Both therapies have shown promising results in treating blood cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, by harnessing the power of the immune system to fight cancer.</p></p>
